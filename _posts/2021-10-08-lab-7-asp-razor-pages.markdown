title:  "Lab 7 ASP.NET Razor Pages"

I set up a repository for the lab database on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/scgaskins/csci340lab7).

I thought that the Razor Pages tutorial was pretty well written overall. It did a good job of explaining what we were doing at each stage of the process. There were not really any parts that were too confusing or challenging.

It was fairly easy to translate the tutorial to making my own web application. My database didn't store any data types that weren't stored in the tutorial database, so I was mostly able to follow the tutorial, changing the relevant parts. I feel pretty confident about making another application. I would probably need to do a bit of research if I used data types other than strings, dates, and decimals, but I think I understand the core ideas.

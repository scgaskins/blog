Overall, I found setting up this blog to be pretty straightforward. I have had prior experience working with the terminal, and the instructions given on the course website were fairly clear. I did make a few mistakes such as making my Gemfile a .txt file and misspelling some things in the _config.yml file, but these were easy fixes.

I've found markdown to be a lot easier to read than HTML. I could read the source code for the "Welcome to Jekyll" post and see fairly well how it would translate. Working in Atom, it has been especially easy to read. Atom displays details such as *italics* and **bold** in the editor, letting me see what they'll look like without loading the blog in a browser. I've been learning markdown from a few different sources:

* The "Welcome to Jekyll" file.
* The [Markdown page][markdown] linked for the lab.
* The [Markdown Cheat Sheet][cheat-sheet]

Overall, I think Jekyll will make posting to this blog pretty easy.

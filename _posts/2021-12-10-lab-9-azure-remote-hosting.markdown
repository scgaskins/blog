This lab did not go very well. We divided up into teams with Kolya working on the first section, Rhett and I working on the second, and Gabby and Alivia working on the third. Kolya made some progress at first but then become stuck and needed to go out of town shortly after. We decided to hold off working on the lab until after Thanksgiving break, but we got caught up in the final project when we got back.

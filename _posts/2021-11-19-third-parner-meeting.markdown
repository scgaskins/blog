title:  "Third Partner Meeting"

My role in the project so far has been to work on the HTML pages and the html.cs files. For the partner meeting, I mainly worked on setting up a page to view the customers of Porch Swing Farms. I scaffolded the pages and set up a basic table. For the presentation, I added sorting, filtering, and paging to the customer table. Going forward I will likely continue working on the HTML for the pages, adding functionality to the tables and incorporating the APIs as my teammates work on the connections to the Wix and OptimoRoute APIs. Though connecting to the APIs is not my specific role, I will likely need to become familiar with them to incorporate them into the HTML.

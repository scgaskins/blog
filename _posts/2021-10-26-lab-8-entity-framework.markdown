I set up a repository for the lab database on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/scgaskins/csci340lab8).

The tutorial for this lab was fairly straightforward and easy to follow. I would say that the most difficult part for me was making sure that I actually understood what I was doing instead of just going through the steps of the tutorial. I thought the changes to the tutorial we had to make for the lab were helpful in keeping me engaged and actively thinking through it. The knowledge that I would later need to use what I learned in the project also helped.

Working with multiple tables definitely added more complexity to this lab. I couldn't just use the CRUD pages generated by the scaffolding needed a lot more modification to account for reading across the different tables. Having multiple tables also made it harder to modify the seed data in the initializer since I would often need to look across multiple entries in each table.

I feel pretty good about creating the database for the Porch Swing Farms. Much of the user interface that we are setting up will be like the CRUD pages we went over in this lab. We will need to account for some concerns that are not present in this lab such as generating egg delivery dates based on the data in the database. On the whole however, I feel prepared for the project.
